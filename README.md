The project is using the Python language.
The project will be able to:

    Read the log file;
    Group the game data of each match;
    Collect kill data;
    Prints a report (grouped information) for each match and a player ranking;
    Generates a report of deaths grouped by death cause for each match.

Requirements to be validated:
   
    When <world> kill a player, that player loses -1 kill score.
    Since <world> is not a player, it should not appear in the list of players or in the dictionary of kills.
    The counter total_kills includes player and world deaths.
